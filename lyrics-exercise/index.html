        <h3>Verse 1</h3>
        I'm still a fan, even though I was salty
            Hate to see you with some other broad, now you happy
            Hate to see you happy, if I'm not the one driving</section>
    <section>
        <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
        I'm so mature, I'm so mature
            I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
            I don't want none, I just want you
            If I can't have you, no one should
            I might

        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        I might kill my ex, not the best idea
            His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
            I might kill my ex, I still love him though
            Rather be in jail than alone

        <h3>Verse 2</h3>
        I get the sense that it's a lost cause
            I get the sense that you might really love her
            This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
            I try to ration with you, no morals or crimes of passion, but damn
            You was out of reach
            You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
            Now I'm in the basement, planning home invasion
            Now you laying face-down, got me singing over a beat

        <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
        I'm so mature, I'm so mature
            I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
            I don't want none, I just want you
            If I can't have you, no one will
            Uh (uh)

        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        I might kill my ex, not the best idea
            His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
            I might kill my ex, I still love him though
            Rather be in jail than alone

        <h3>Bridge</h3>
        I did it all for love (love)
            I did it all on no drugs (drugs)
            I did all of this sober
            I did it all for us, oh
            I did it all for love (love)
            I did it all of this on no drugs (drugs)
            I did all of this sober
            Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'll kill your ex tonight)

    <section>
        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        Uh, I just killed my ex (my ex)
            Not the best idea (idea)
            Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here?
            I just killed my ex (my ex)
            I still love him, though (I do)
            Rather be in Hell than alone
