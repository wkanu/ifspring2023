        <li>My name is William Kanu, I am majoring in Computer Science and I am a senior.</li>
        <li>I am a CompSci major with an HCI minor. After reviewing the description of the class it sounded like a good class to help me practice my design and it was one of the few classes that worked for my minor.</li>
        <li>Yes I have some experience with HTML/CSS/JS. I learned it my sophmore year and this will be my third semester as head TA for Intro to Web Development.</li>
        <li>I hope to learn more about how to make design choices and practice my CSS. I really like coding and ive been functionality driven which caused me to not dive much at all into CSS past the basics.</li>
        <li>I expect the designs on the screen to be more in depth and detailed. It might also be harder to implement on the screen in comparison to just drawing your design.</li>
        <li><a ref="https://www.figma.com/">Link Here!</a>This is actually a design website. I feel like this websites design is effective as it shows some of the great things you can use it to create.</li>
        <li><a ref="https://www.nike.com/">Link Here!</a>This sight displays effective communication as it is easy to navigate. When you enter the sight things are catorgorized which I believe displays effective communication.</li>
        <li><a ref="https://www.apple.com/">Link Here!</a>This sight works well because the design aspect isnt overbearing and it's easy to navigate. When people are going to apple they have an idea of want they want already and I feel that this simple design displays that effectively.</li>
